decoding is slow than coreutils...

benchmark results:
- startup overhead is about 0.1s more than coreutils
- stdin decode w/  ignore is 250% faster
- stdin decode w/o ignore is  80% faster
- file  decode w/  ignore is  10% faster

- file  decode w/o ignore is  20% slower
- file  encode w/o wrap   is  20% slower
- stdin encode w/o wrap   is  10% slower

- stdin encode w/  wrap   is 100% slower
- file  encode w/  wrap   is 300% slower


summary:
- coreutils is slow with stdin
- i'm slow with wrapping
