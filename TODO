base-32 benchmarking

ensure handling of padding is correct and matches coreutil implementation

benchmark results:
- startup overhead is about 0.1s more than coreutils

- file  decode w/  ignore is 1.14 faster
- file  encode w/  wrap   is 1.01 faster
- stdin decode w/  ignore is 2.38 faster
- stdin decode w/o ignore is 1.78 faster
- stdin encode w/  wrap   is 1.15 faster
- stdin encode w/o wrap   is 1.09 faster

- file  decode w/o ignore is 1.19 slower
- file  encode w/o wrap   is 1.16 slower


summary:
- coreutils is slow with stdin
- coreutils has some trick to make decode w/o ignore faster, and encode w/o wrap faster
