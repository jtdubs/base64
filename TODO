base-32 fuzz targets
base-32 benchmarking
rewrite base32 decode in new style matching base64 decode...

ensure handling of padding is correct and matches coreutil implementation

benchmark results:
- startup overhead is about 0.1s more than coreutils
- file  decode w/  ignore is 2.10 times faster
- file  decode w/o ignore is 1.43 times faster
- stdin decode w/  ignore is 3.81 times faster
- stdin decode w/o ignore is 2.72 times faster

- file  encode w/  wrap   is 1.01 faster
- file  encode w/o wrap   is 1.16 slower
- stdin encode w/  wrap   is 1.15 faster
- stdin encode w/o wrap   is 1.09 faster

- file  encode w/  wrap   is 1.03 times faster
- file  encode w/o wrap   is 1.15 times SLOWER
- stdin encode w/  wrap   is 1.15 times faster
- stdin encode w/o wrap   is 1.07 times faster


summary:
- coreutils is slow with stdin
- coreutils encode w/o wrap is fast...
